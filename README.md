# CodeClause_Internship_URL Shortener

## Introduction 

The URL shortener project is a web application designed to simplify long URLs, making them more user-friendly and manageable. It generates short, unique URLs that redirect users to the original long URLs, making them easier to share on various platforms.

# Project Description
Developed using Python and the Flask web framework, the URL shortener project consists of a user-friendly front-end and a powerful back-end. The front-end provides a simple HTML interface for users to input their long URLs, while the back-end handles the logic of generating and managing shortened URLs.

# Key Features

1. Front-end Interface: The user interface allows users to enter long URLs and quickly obtain their shortened counterparts.
2. Short Code Generation: The project generates random alphanumeric short codes for each long URL, ensuring the uniqueness of shortened URLs.
3. Redirection Mechanism: When users access a shortened URL, the back-end looks up the short code in its mapping to redirect them to the original URL.
   
# Demonstrated Skills

The project showcases proficiency in Python programming and web development using the Flask framework. Additionally, it demonstrates knowledge of front-end development with HTML and CSS. Understanding HTTP redirection and URL handling is also evident in the project's implementation.

# Conclusion

The URL shortener project highlights practical web development skills using Python and Flask. With its ability to simplify and enhance URL sharing, the project presents an exciting opportunity for further growth and the implementation of advanced features.
